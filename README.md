# MassEmailerOutOfTheBox
I've been using this code to send out mass emails often, and thought I'd put it online.

Thanks to niftylettuce for making the email-sending package I use. It's pretty much a slightly packaged version of their code, just slightly fleshed out for your garden-variety spamming needs.

If you just want to send out a bunch of personalized emails, this is a small little thing to make it even easier, without using the normal proprietary stuff or the free tools that already redirect to spam.

This can work with either Gmail or Outlook so far, including with GSuite and Outlook's equivalent feature (I tested it), just follow the respective sub-READMEs.
